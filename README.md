# JavaScript Sequence Practice Problems

This repository contains solutions to a series of JavaScript sequence practice problems. The problems are solved using JavaScript's built-in `Math` object to generate random numbers and perform arithmetic operations.

## Problem Statements Solved in this demonstration.

1. **Use REPL – Random Function Math.floor(Math.random() * 10); to get Single Digit.**

2. **Use REPL – Use Random to get Dice Number between 1 to 6**

3. **Use REPL – Add two Random Dice Number and Print the Result**

4. **Use Script & Debug – Write a program that reads 5 Random 2 Digit values, then find their sum and the average**

5. **Use Script & Debug – Unit Conversion**
   - a. Convert a length from inches to feet.
   - b. Calculates the area of a rectangular plot with dimensions 60 feet by 40 feet in meters.
   - c. Calculates the total area of 25 such plots in acres.

## Running the Code
